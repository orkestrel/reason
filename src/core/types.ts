// (plain data records) to produce traceable RESULTS. Three layers: the `Reason`
// orchestrator (registry + dispatch + events), four reasoners (quantitative /
// logical / symbolic / inferential), and three injectable operators (Evaluator /
// Transformer / Aggregator). Nothing mutates its inputs; every result is a fresh
// object carrying `success`, a human-readable `trace`, and `errors`. Types are
// the source of truth (AGENTS §2); every discriminant names its axis, never
// `kind` / `type` (AGENTS §4.4): `reasoning` splits definitions and results,
// `form` splits expression nodes, `origin` splits factor sources.
